API Notes: JavaScriptCore framework
===================================

Reference counting
------------------

The various JavaScriptCore types (such as ``JSValueRef`` and ``JSContextRef``) are C types with manual reference counting. PyObjC
does *not* manage the reference counts for you, you'll have to call the correct retain and release functions manually to avoid
leaking memory and/or crashing.


``JSStringGetCharactersPtr``
----------------------------

This function is not supported. Convert the string to a Python type using ``JSStringCopyCFString`` or ``JSStringGetUTF8CString``.
