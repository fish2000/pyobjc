Building the Module
===================

*** 
*** NOTE1: On MacOS X you must build and install Python as a framework
***	  (check Mac/OSX/README in the Python tree on how to do this).
***
*** NOTE2: You'll need Python 2.3 or later, Python 2.2 is NOT good enough!
***

The module uses the distutils package included with Python 2.0 and
beyond.   This package provides a single interface for building and
packaging the module.   To see usage documentation for the module,
issue the '--help' command:

% python setup.py --help

To see an inventory of building and packaging commands, issue the
command:

% python setup.py --help-commands

The following command will build and install the pyobjc module:

% python setup.py install

The setup.py system can also be used to create source and binary
distribution archives automatically.


XXX Ronald: Everything below this should be updated.

Demos
=====

If it works and you are on NeXTSTEP (or just curious ;-) go in
Demo/ObjC and try the examples: though very simple, they give the
idea; both are based on NeXTSTEP' bundles, so you need that OS to
enjoy them.

The LittleButtonedWindow demo puts a window on the screen, with a
button in it.

XXX NOT UPDATED YET XXX

AlertPanel will put an NXAlertPanel on the screen, completely piloted
by the Python script;

Forward will attach a Python instance method as the `action' of an
ObjC object and then that object will be asked to perform an unknown
method on the Python object... intricated to explain, easier to see ;-)

ShellText is actually one of the shorter ways to build a NeXTSTEP
application able to show in its own window its *entire* source code ;-)


Documentation
=============

The documentation of the module is contained in three LaTeX sources in
the `Doc/' directory: if you want include them in the Library manual,
simply add the following lines

        \input{libPyObjC}

near the end of the file `Doc/lib.tex', just before the inclusion of the
index (\input{lib.ind}).
