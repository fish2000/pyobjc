A proof of concept `IDN spoofing defense`__ for Safari (tested with v1.2.4 on 
Mac OS X 10.3.8). Demonstrates how to write an application that detects the 
launch of another application by bundle identifier, how to use ``objc.inject`` 
to load code into another application, how to override the implementation of 
an existing class but still call back into the original implementation, and 
how to reduce the size of such an application/plugin combination by using 
symlinks to share object files (the PyObjC extensions in this case).
