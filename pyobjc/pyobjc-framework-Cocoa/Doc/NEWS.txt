====================================

Version 2.2
-----------

* Introduce bindings for SnowLeopard (MacOSX 10.6)

* Introduce ``Foundation.NSDisabledSuddenTermination``, 
  a context object for use with python's ``with`` statement::

     with NSDisabledSuddenTermination:
     	# Sudden termination is disabled here
	pass

* Introduce unittests that check that API bindings actually
  work, in particular all bindings that require custom 
  metadata
