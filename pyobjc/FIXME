* [ronald] MallocDebug.app causes a crash in pyobjc (Try running TableModel in
   MallocDebug)

* [ronald] Restructure header files in Modules/objc

* [ronald] Contents MANIFEST is no longer valid
  [bbum] Anyway to move to a MANIFEST.in and have most of MANIFEST be
  autogenerated?  It is a nightmare to maintain, as is.

* [ronald] NSAutoreleasePool raises an exception when you use
  'retain'. NSInvocation    calls 'retain' on the receiver (at least in
  the way we use it...)

  Luckily users normally don't have to create an autorelease pool.

  [bbum] Not true.  Anyone using PyObjC to build shell script like
  functionality will need to   create an autorelease pool at the
  beginning of the script to avoid lots of warnings about leaking
  objects.

* [ronald] pyobjc-0.6.1 and earlier contain some code that is questionable in
  newer releases of Python. Need to check if all code, and repair where 
  necessary.
