Web Services Tool

Web Services Tool queries XML-RPC enabled servers via the "standard" introspection methods and displays a summary of the API.   It is implemented in Python using the PyObjC module.

To use the application, simply provide the connection window with an URL to the XML-RPC handler of a web server.  If the server at least implements the listMethods() method, the app will display a list of methods.

Source for both the pyobjc module and the Web Services Tool are available via the pyobjc sourceforge CVS repository.
