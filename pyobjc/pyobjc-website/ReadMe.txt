This project will one day be used to replace the PyObjC website by something
new and shiny, but is pretty useless in its current state.

Usage::

   python setup.py build
  
This will recreate the website in 'htdocs'. The website is a collection of 
static (html) files.

Done:
- Regenerate online examples from the source tree

Todo:
- Update all examples to have a summary.txt (short description for 
  the lists of examples) and readme.txt (a longer description). The readme.txt
  is optional.
- (Examples) The summary should be extracted from the readme file
- Use the current website to create better template files
- Home page and news
- Extract documentation for pyobjc-core and framework wrappers
- Download page
- The current L&F on pyobjc.sf.net sucks, find something better
