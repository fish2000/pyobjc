PyObjC 2.2 released
=====================

There are relatively few user-visibly changes from the last
release. 

This release can be installed using ``easy_install``

Usage::

   $ easy_install pyobjc==2.2

This will install the core bridge as well as all stable
framework wrappers.

*NOTE2*: easy_install will not install py2app, you will have
to install that manually.
