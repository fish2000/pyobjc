A couple of useful modules imported from the (Mac)Python CVS tree. They
are necessary to build .app bundles using python scripts (e.g.
Examples/TableModel/buildapp.py).

There are two reasons they are included here:
a) They're not available in Python 2.2
b) They're not installed by default in a static (non-framework) build
   of CVS Python. Note: this is (probably/hopefully) going to change
   before the release of Python 2.3.

They are automatically installed by the main setup.py script if needed.
