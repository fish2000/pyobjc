subject: ANN: PyObjC 1.1

PyObjC 1.1 is now available for download at http://pyobjc.sourceforge.net/  

PyObjC is a bridge between Python and Objective-C.  It allows full
featured Cocoa applications to be written in pure Python.  It is also
easy to use other frameworks containing Objective-C class libraries
from Python and to mix in Objective-C, C and C++ source.

Python is a highly dynamic programming language with a shallow learning 
curve.  It combines remarkable power with very clear syntax.

The installer package includes a number of Project Builder templates for 
easily creating new Cocoa-Python projects, as well as support for 
syntax-coloring Python files in Project Builder.

PyObjC also supports full introspection of Objective-C classes and 
direct invocation of Objective-C APIs from the interactive interpreter.

PyObjC requires MacOS X 10.2 or later.  PyObjC works both with the Apple 
provided Python installation in MacOS X 10.2 (and later) and with 
MacPython 2.3b1.  Users of MacPython 2.3b1 can install PyObjC though the 
PackageManager application.

The major improvement of PyObjC 1.1 is support for Key-Value Observing. It
is now possible to write programs that use Cocoa Bindings. There are also 
numerous new examples.

PyObjC is released with an open source license.
