Introduction
------------

This document contains an (incomplete) list of work items. 

Important items
---------------

Better documentation
....................

* There should be more developer and and end-user documentation.

* The tutorials should have screenshots for the website.

* There should be a document containing references to "third party" tutorials,
  articles, and information about PyObjC.

* The documentation should be updated to take advantage of reStructuredText
  features.  Currently, documentation doesn't refer to itself consistently
  (usually without hyperlink), and most documents are missing metadata.

* build_html should include a step that performs syntax highlighting for
  Python and Objective-C code snippets.

Test suite
..........

The test suite needs to be enhanced. 

* Somehow find a way to check code-coverage of the unittests.

* Tests that exercise Key-Value Observing in a way that crashes older versions
  of PyObjC.

* tests for all functions in ``Modules/*/*Mapping*.m``
  (including IMPs)

* tests for all non-generated function wrappers (and some for the generated
  functions as well, just in case the generator script is buggy)

* tests where Python implementation of method with output arguments returns
  the wrong value (type, number of values)

* Add tests for accepting any sequence when depythonifying structs and arrays.

* Add more tests for objc_support.m to unittest.c

* Add tests for OC_PythonArray, OC_PythonDict to unittest.c


The first two bullets require at least some GUI tests.



Less important items
--------------------

Refactor some parts of the bridge
.................................

From the top of my head:

* Restructure selector.m, this file is too long and complicated. We could
  do away with the difference between method implemented in Python and
  Objective-C.

* Remove the need for ``pyobjc_classMethods``, you should be able to call
  class methods in the obvious way.  This would (finally) close `836247`__.

.. __: http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=836247&group_id=14534&atid=114534

* Likewise for class-builder.m, this file is way to large.

* We've several types that wrap pointer values, such as ``SessionWrapper`` in
  ``Modules/AppKit``. Should add a function for creating these types, 
  possibly exposed to C code.

Support for GNUstep
...................

The current SVN version contains some support for GNUstep, this needs to
be enhanced.

Unless somebody actually starts working on this GNUstep support will slowly
fade away.

Project templates
.................

Nobody seems to care enough about the templates to actually maintain them, this
is a shame. 

* Integrate Xcode template with py2app, somehow

  (some work to this end exists in the svn sandbox)

* Update or remove the Project Builder templates

  I prefer updating them, by rebuilding the Xcode templates in Project Builder.

  This would require Python 2.3 on Jaguar.

Complete Cocoa wrapping
.......................

We do not yet have a 100% coverage of the Cocoa API's. We also need code in
the testsuite that checks if the function wrappers are working as expected.

Not all constants and enums from Cocoa are currently wrapped.  The annotations
for input/output arguments are not all checked and may not be complete or
correct.  

We also don't support all "difficult" methods yet, implementing these is
not too hard but it is a lot of work.

Note that even though we do not have 100% coverage of Cocoa, the majority
of useful functions, constants, and "difficult" methods are wrapped.  If you
run across a missing or incorrectly wrapped constant, function, or method
please report it as a bug and/or post to pyobjc-dev about the issue.  This is
one area we intend to improve after the release of 1.2 when our new
wrapper-generators are in a more complete state.

Pickle support
..............

Objective-C objects don't support pickling.

This is post-1.2 work, in general this is a hard problem because it may 
involve object cycles that cross the Python-ObjC boundary.

NSCoder support
...............

It might be useful to add default implementations of ``encodeWithCoder:`` and
``initWithCoder:`` methods to Python subclasses of Objective-C classes that 
implement these.  Note that property list types should already be serializable
(``int``, ``long``, ``unicode``, ``list``, ``tuple``, ``dict``).

See also `Pickle support`.

``-copy``
.........

There are issues with implementing ``-copy`` in python, these need to be fixed.

Specifically, overriding an existing ``-copy`` implementation does not work 
unless ``__slots__ == ()``


Known issues
............

It is impossible to support methods with a variable number of arguments in the
generic code (you have to re-implement almost all of the logic of these 
methods in order to know how many and which types of arguments are expected).
Luckily there are not many varargs methods and most (if no all) of them can
be easily avoided.

All existing varargs methods should be located and documented. Where possible
we should provide custom wrappers, otherwise we should document alternatives.

Limitations such as the above should be clearly documented elsewhere, these
are not necessarily TODO items.

Code cleanup
............

* Check all error/exception messages

* Check/cleanup error handling

* Finish in-code documentation for the C code

* SessionWrapper (in ``Modules/AppKit``) is one of several types that wrap 
  a single pointer, create a function to build such types (similar to
  ``Modules/objc/struct-wrapper.m``)

* Use the ``CArray`` API whenever appropriate.

Cleanup Examples
................

The CurrencyConverter example should be removed, this should be the same as the
final step of the tutorial. It isn't at the moment because additional cruft in
the example.

* dictionary.py
  Should be a unittest, and should be added to the (non-existing) manual

* pydict-to-objcdict.py
  Move to unittests

* subclassing-objective-c.py
  Move to documentation (unittest?)

* super-call.py
  Move to documentation  (unittest?)

Add examples that demonstrate:

- how to use a lot of Cocoa features

- how to integrate with MacPython

- how to use PIL with Cocoa 

Performance tuning/testing
..........................

Design and implement a set of performance tests for the bridge. Use this to 
investigate and fix any possible performance problems.

Add freelists
.............

PyObjCSelector objects and PyObjCObject objects are created on
a regular basis, we should check if using freelists would speed this up. See
also `Performance tuning/testing`.


Formal Protocols, Distributed Objects
.....................................

``DO`` seems to use formal protocols, we don't fully support those. There is 
an equivalent to ``@protocol(Foo)``, but it is not yet possible to define
new protocols in Python.

Links to Apple documentation
............................

Links to Apple documentation are not stable, can we add a layer of indirection
here, e.g. link to the PyObjC website that will redirect to the right
location?

We should also provide links to locally installed documentation,
especially in the documentation that will be installed on the users machine.

Implement more of NSMutableDictionary in OC_PythonDictionary
.............................................................

The implementation of OC_PythonDictionary is very minimal, we should add
additional methods in the NSMutableDictionary interface if those can be 
implemented efficiently. The default implementation will take care of the
methods we cannot implement efficiently.

And the same is true of OC_PythonArray

Clean up OC_PythonObject
........................

The code is a mess.

Rewrite scripts/find-raw-pointers.py
....................................

This is a script for finding 'difficult' methods. The script should be 
refactored to make it easier to create readable reports.

Finish struct-wrapper.m
.......................

We need more unittests and an implementation of the extended slice interface.

Why does the GC support cause an assertion failure when it is enabled?

Finish refactoring of the code-generator scripts
................................................

1. Change code-generator scripts to use loadBundleFunctions, etc.

2. Move the code-generator scripts to ``PyObjCTools``, to make it easier
   for others to generate wrappers.

3. Install ``pyobjc-api.h``.

setup.py cleanup
................

* Use 'WrapperGenerator.py', probably need to create a custom build action
  for that.

Unique proxies for Python objects
.................................

Some Cocoa/CoreFoundation API's basically require that ``a[0] is a[0]``. The
container wrappers contain support for that, but we should try to move that
into the generic core: there should be at most one Objective-C proxy object
alive for every Python object (just like there's at most one Python proxy for
every Objective-C object).

NSNumber
........

The implementation of NSNumber on Mac OS X can not be trusted to return the
right thing for objCType, it should be a proxied object like NSString.

NSDecimal vs decimal
....................

Check if it is possible to wrap ``NSDecimal`` using ``decimal`` (and v.v.).

Only implement this when it is possible to convert without loss of information.

NSSet vs set
............

Check if it is possible to wrap ``NSSet`` using ``set`` (and v.v.).

Only implement this when it is possible to convert without loss of information.

Python 2.4
..........

Python 2.4 introduces a decorator syntax. Add convenience functions that
make it easier to use decorators with PyObjC. 

Also add example programs using decorators. Actually, first add the example(s)
and extract useful convenience functions from those.

An example of a convenience function would be::

	import objc

	def method_signature(signature):
		def make_selector(func):
			return objc.selector(func, signature=signature)
		return make_selector

Which can be used like this::
	
	class FooClass (NSObject):

		@method_signature("v@:i")
		def myIntMethod_(self, value):
			pass

NSLog, stringWithFormat, ...
............................

Functions and methods that use format strings are not properly wrapped. Fix
that.
