Introduction
------------

This document contains an (incomplete) list of work items. 

Important items
---------------

Better documentation
....................

There should be more developer documentation and end-user documentation is
virtually non-existant. Related to this is the website: This should be filled.

We should also add scripts to convert documentation to a format that is 
useable on the website.

Also needed: document listing the differences between Objective-C Cocoa and
Python Cocoa: which functions/methods are not available, list differences
in arguments (e.g. NSBeginAlertSheet has a variable number of arguments in
Objective-C, the format-arguments are not present in Python).

Test suite
..........

The test suite needs to be enhanced.

* Tests that exercise Key-Value Observing in a way that crashes older versions
  of PyObjC.

* tests for all functions in ``Modules/*/*Mapping*.m``
  (including IMPs)

* tests for all non-generated function wrappers (and some for the generated
  functions as well, just in case the generator script is buggy)

* tests where Python implementation of method with output arguments returns
  the wrong value (type, number of values)

* Add tests for accepting any sequence when depythonifying structs and arrays.

* Add more tests for objc_support.m to unittest.c

* Add tests for OC_PythonArray, OC_PythonDict to unittest.c


The first two bullets require at least some GUI tests.



Less important items
--------------------

Refactor some parts of the bridge
.................................

From the top of my head:

* Restructure selector.m, this file is too long and complicated. We could
  do away with the difference between method implemented in Python and ObjC.

* Likewise for class-builder.m, this file is way to large.

* We've several types that wrap pointer values, such as ``SessionWrapper`` in
  ``Modules/AppKit``. Should add a function for creating these types, 
  possibly exposed to C code.

Support for GNUstep
...................

The current SVN version contains some support for GNUstep, this needs to
be enhanced.

Unless somebody actually starts working on this GNUstep support will slowly
fade away.

Plugin bundles
..............

Allow for more than one class to show up in the bundle via
``+[NSBundle bundleForClass:]``.  The implementation of this would statically
allocate some fixed large number of class wrappers in the __OBJC section of
the py2app bundletemplate.  The class builder would have a "stack" of
allocation spaces for classes, and the bundletemplate would push/pop this
stack.

Project templates
.................

Nobody seems to care enough about the templates to actually maintain them, this
is a shame. 

* Integrate Xcode template with py2app, somehow

* Update or remove the Project Builder templates

  I prefer updating them, by rebuilding the Xcode templates in Project Builder.

  This would require Python 2.3 on Jaguar.

Complete Cocoa wrapping
.......................

We do not yet have a 100% coverage of the Cocoa API's. We also need code in
the testsuite that checks if the function wrappers are working as expected.

Someone needs to check if we correctly export all constants from Cocoa and if
the generation script finds all global functions. Simularly for the annotations
for input/output arguments.

We also don't support all "difficult" methods yet, implementing these is
not too hard but it is a lot of work.

Pickle support
..............

Objective-C objects don't support pickling.

This is post-1.2 work, in general this is a hard problem because it may 
involve object cycles that cross the Python-ObjC boundary.

NSCoder support
...............

It might be usefull to add default implementations of ``encodeWithCoder:`` and
``initWithCoder:`` methods to Python subclasses of Objective-C classes that 
implement these.  Note that property list types should already be serializable
(int, long, unicode, list, tuple, dict).

See also `Pickle support`.

``-copy``
.........

There are issues with implementing ``-copy`` in python, these need to be fixed.

Specifically, overriding an existing ``-copy`` implementation does not work 
unless ``__slots__ == ()``

XXX: is this still true?

Known issues
............

It is impossible to support methods with a variable number of arguments in the
generic code (you have to reimplement allmost all of the logic of these 
methods in order to know how many and which types of arguments are expected).
Luckily there are not many varargs methods and most (if no all) of them can
be easily avoided.

XXX: The paragraph above should be moved to the documentation, it is not a 
todo item.

All existing varargs methods should be located and documented. Where possible
we should provide custom wrappers, otherwise we should document alternatives.

Code cleanup
............

* Check all error/exception messages

* Check/cleanup error handling

* Finish in-code documentation for the C code

* SessionWrapper (in ``Modules/AppKit``) is one of several types that wrap 
  a single pointer, create a function to build such types (simular to
  ``Modules/objc/struct-wrapper.m``)

* Use the ``CArray`` API whenever appropriate.

Cleanup Examples
................

The CurrentConvertor example should be removed, this should be the same as the
final step of the tutorial. It isn't at the moment because additional cruft in
the example.

* dictionary.py
  Should be a unittest, and should be added to the (non-existing) manual

* pydict-to-objcdict.py
  Move to unittests

* subclassing-objective-c.py
  Move to documentation (unittest?)

* super-call.py
  Move to documentation  (unittest?)

Add examples that demonstrate:

- how to use a lot of Cocoa features

- how to integrate with MacPython

- how to use PIL with Cocoa 

Performance tuning/testing
..........................

Design and implement a set of performance tests for the bridge. Use this to 
investigate and fix any possible performance problems.

Add freelists
.............

PyObjCSelector objects and PyObjCObject objects are created on
a regular basis, we should check if using freelists would speed this up. See
also `Performance tuning/testing`.


Key-Value Encoding
..................

XXX: Need to check if the current implementation is correct.

XXX: It has proven to work quite well, is this still a TODO item?

The takeValue:forKey: implementation correctly emits notifications (on MacOS X
10.3). MacOS X 10.3 is currently detected at compile-time, this should probably
be done dynamicly.

The right notifications are not yet emitted for:

* setattr() on Objective-C objects

  There is preliminary (sp?) support in objc-object.m, but I'm not sure if this
  we really should do this at all. 

* setattr() on pure Python objects

  It is extremely difficult to detect such changes, even finding the right ObjC
  wrapper is not possible at the moment (but that is fixable).

  The documentation should mention that observations don't work for pure
  Python objects.

Scott Anguish mentioned on one of the Cocoa lists that the right way to 
override the key-value related methods is different from what we're doing.

Formal Protocols, Distributed Objects
.....................................

``DO`` seems to use formal protocols, we don't support those at all. 

XXX: We do support accessing protocols (e.g. an equivalent to @protocol(Foo)),
but you cannot define new protocols in python yet.
XXX: Is it still true that we can't define new protocols from Python?

Links to Apple documentation
............................

Links to Apple documentation are not stable, can we add a layer of indirection
here, e.g. link to the PyObjC website that will redirect to the right
location?

But: we should also provide links to locally installed documetation, especially
in the documentation that will be installed on the users machine.

Implement more of NSMutableDictionary in OC_PythonDictionary
.............................................................

The implementation of OC_PythonDictionary is very minimal, we should add
additional methods in the NSMutableDictionary interface if those can be 
implemented efficiently. The default implementation will take care of the
methods we cannot implement efficiently.

And the same is true of OC_PythonArray

Clean up OC_PythonObject
........................

The code is a mess.

Rewrite scripts/find-raw-pointers.py
....................................

This is a script for finding 'difficult' methods. The script should be 
refactored to make it easier to create readable reports.

Finish struct-wrapper.m
.......................

XXX: Is this still true?

We need more unittests and an implementation of the extended slice interface.

Why does the GC support cause an assertion failure when it is enabled?

Finish refactoring of the code-generator scripts
................................................

1. Change code-generator scripts to use loadBundleFunctions, etc.

2. Move the code-generator scripts to ``PyObjCTools``, to make it easier
   for others to generate wrappers.

3. Install ``pyobjc-api.h``.

setup.py cleanup
................

XXX: Why not use docarticle?

* Don't use docarticle to create HTML from build_html.

* Use 'WrapperGenerator.py', probably need to create a custom build action
  for that.
