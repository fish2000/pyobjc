The mapping from Objective-C onto Python is almost complete, but the following
things should be kept in mind:

- Objective-C only has single inheritance. You can use multiple inheritance in
  the python code, but only to mix in 'fully python' classes.

- In objective-C it is valid to call methods on nil, these calls will be
  ignored. The nil 'object' is mapped to None and None will not ignore method
  calls, but will most likely raise an AttributeError. You'll have to remember
  this when translating from Objective-C to python.

- Some Cocoa classes store references to objects while not increasing the 
  reference count. One of those is NSOutlineView. A side-effect of this is that
  you *must* use subclasses of NSObject in your NSOutlineView model.
