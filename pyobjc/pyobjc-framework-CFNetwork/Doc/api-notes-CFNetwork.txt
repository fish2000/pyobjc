=====================================
API Notes for the framework CFNetwork
=====================================

* ``CFNetworkExecuteProxyAutoConfigurationScript`` and ``CFNetworkExecuteProxyAutoConfigurationURL``

  These functions are not yet supported because they require a manually written proxy function.

* ``CFHostGetAddressing``

   This proxy crashes python in the unittests, I haven't debugged the issue yet and it may be 
   caused by bad use of this function in the tests.

* ``CFHostSetClient``

  This API is not yet supported from Python because they require a manually written proxy function.
