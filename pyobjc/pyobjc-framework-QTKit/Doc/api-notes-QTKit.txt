=================================
API Notes for the QTKit framework
=================================

* Functions ``QTMakeTimeWithTimeRecord`` and ``QTGetTimeRecord`` are not supported.

* The integration with classical Quicktime API is not properly tested at the moment.
  (And note that that API is deprecated by Apple, use the QTKit API where possible).
