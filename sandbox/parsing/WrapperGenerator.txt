- Determine intraframework dependencies based on angle #import and #include
  Start from the canonical framework header
  Make sure to look for sub-frameworks!

- Look for @interface statements

- Look for @protocol statements

- Look for constant NSStrings

- Look for global variables based on a given prefix (FOUNDATION_EXPORT, for example)

- Look for enum statements

- Look for simple #define statements

- Look for exported functions

- Try and wrap static inline functions (i.e. FOUNDATION_STATIC_INLINE)

- Try and determine which selectors and functions will need special treatment (pointer arguments)
