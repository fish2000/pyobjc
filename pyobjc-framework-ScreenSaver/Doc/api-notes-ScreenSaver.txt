API Notes: ScreenSaver framework
================================

The full API is described in `Apple's documentation`__, both
the C and Objective-C APIs are available (but see the `API Notes`_ below).

.. __: https://developer.apple.com/reference/screensaver/

These bindings are accessed through the ``ScreenSaver`` package (that is, ``import ScreenSaver``).


API Notes
---------

The PyObjC bindings for the ScreenSaver framework are complete.


Platform limitations
--------------------

Screen savers are plugins for the screen saver engine, this means
that a screen saver must contain compiled C code for the correct
architectures.

On Mac OS X 10.6 and Mac OS X 10.7 you cannot use PyObjC to write a screen saver
because the screen saver engine uses Objetive-C Garbage Collection and
that is not supported by PyObjC.

Screen savers work again in OS X 10.8.

For OSX 10.6 or later on Intel CPUs the binary must contain support
for the x86_64 (64-bit Intel) code, on earlier OSX releases support
for i386 (32-bit Intel) is needed.

See the section on "Binary Compatibility" in Apple's documentation
for more information.
