Installing into System python
=============================

It is technically possible to install new versions of 
PyObjC into the system install of python (such as using
``/usr/bin/easy_install``). 

We advise not to do that however, because bits of the system
may use PyObjC and we're not 100% upward compatible w.r.t. 
the version of PyObjC that's included with MacOSX.
