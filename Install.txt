Notes for Subversion users
==========================

To build PyObjC from the Subversion repository, you will need an installation
of libffi.  A snapshot of libffi modified to build inside the PyObjC source
tree is available from the `PyObjC download site`_.  To use this, simply move
the extracted libffi-src folder to your PyObjC source folder.  If you would
like to use another libffi source location, update the variable
``LIBFFI_SOURCES`` at the top of setup.py.  Release versions of PyObjC include
a compatible libffi snapshot.

Building the package
====================

PyObjC is built and installed using the distutils package included with Python
2.0 and beyond.  distutils provides a single interface for building and
packaging the PyObjC via a ``setup.py`` script. To see usage documentation
for ``setup.py``, issue the ``--help`` command::

  % python setup.py --help

To see an inventory of building and packaging commands, issue the
command::

  % python setup.py --help-commands

The following command will build and install the PyObjC package::

  % python setup.py install

The setup.py system can also be used to create source and binary
distribution archives automatically.

Use ``sudo`` to install the PyObjC package into a the Apple supplied
Python's site-packages directory on OS X 10.2 and greater:

% sudo python setup.py install

If you have multiple versions of Python installed on your system, the
above will only install PyObjC for whatever version of Python is the
default on the command line.   Make sure you are installing PyObjC
against the correct version of Python.

Note that there is a known bug in Python 2.3.0 
(as shipped with MacOS X 10.3.x), such that when another framework Python is 
installed it will not link extensions (such as PyObjC) properly, rendering them
unusable.  If you intend to build PyObjC for Python 2.3.0, ensure that no other
framework Python is installed, such as a previous installation for MacOS X
10.2.  For more information on this and other Python issues on MacOS X,
please refer to the `pythonmac.org FAQ`_.

.. _`pythonmac.org FAQ`: http://pythonmac.org/wiki/FAQ

If you have a previous version of PyObjC installed, you may see an exception
such as ``Wrong version of PyObjC C API``.  If this happens, you should
delete any previous installation of PyObjC and the build folder in your
new sources and try again.  PyObjC will typically be installed to a folder
of the same name in /Library/Python/2.3 or /Library/Python/2.3/site-packages.

To be able to build the wrappers for the WebKit framework (included with
Safari 1.0), you'll have to install the WebKit SDK. You can download 
this from the `ADC website <http://connect.apple.com>`_.

PyObjC has limited support for `GNUstep`_. See `Doc/gnustep.txt`_ for 
more information.

Examples
========

The `examples directory`_ contains a number of projects that demonstrate
various features of the PyObjC bridge. The scripts at the top level of
the `examples directory`_ were mostly written to test a particular
feature of the bridge (or document a bug until a fix could be found).

.. _`examples directory`: Examples/00ReadMe.html

CurrencyConverter and TableModel are both examples of standalone
Cocoa-Python applications.  To build and execute::

  % cd TableModel
  % python buildapp.py build

The WebServicesTool is an example of Cocoa-Python applications created via 
the Cocoa-Python project template found in the 
``ProjectBuilder Extras/Project Templates`` directory.  Use Project Builder 
to build the applications.


Project Templates
=================

Xcode on MacOS X 10.3
.....................

The ``Xcode`` directory contains some file and project that make it easier to
work with Python and PyObjC when using `Xcode`__.

.. __: http://www.apple.com/xcode

Copy the templates in ``Xcode/File templates`` to ``/Library/Application Support/Apple/Development Tools/File Templates``. Copy the templates in ``Xcode/Project Templates`` to ``/Library/Application Support/Apple/Development Tools/Project Templates``.

There are two project templates:

* Cocoa-Python Application

  A project created from this template is designed to implement standalone,
  pure-Python, applications that are compatible with Apple's build of Python as
  well as all other builds of python that support PyObjC.

  When building the 'install' target, the resulting application wrapper will
  included the PyObjC package and can be launched on any stock OS X 10.3 system
  without requiring PyObjC to be preinstalled.

  Note that the optional 'BSD Subsystem' component of MacOS X is required,
  however it is installed by default and should be present on most systems.

* Cocoa-Python Document-based Application

  This template works like the Cocoa-Python Application template in that it
  is compatible with the Apple build of Python.   It creates an application 
  that uses Cocoa's Multiple Document Architecture in the same fashion as the
  default Cocoa Document-based Application supplied with Project Builder. 

Note that Python applications built on MacOS X 10.3 are not compatible with
MacOS X 10.2.  At this time, a MacOS X 10.2 system must be used to build
MacOS X 10.2 compatible applications.

Project Builder on MacOS X 10.2
...............................

The ``ProjectBuilder Extras`` directory contains additional files that can
be used with Project Builder. The directory ``Specifications`` contains files
that enable syntax coloring for Python files in Project Builder.

The ``Project Templates`` directory contains project templates for
Project Builder.  These have to be copied to
``/Developer/ProjectBuilder Extras/Project Templates/Application`` before
they are useable from Project Builder.

There are three templates available:

* Cocoa-Python Application

  A project created from this template is designed to implement standalone,
  pure-Python, applications that are compatible with Apple's build of Python as
  well as all other builds of python that support PyObjC.

  When building the 'install' target, the resulting application wrapper will
  included the PyObjC module and can be launched on any stock OS X 10.2 system
  without requiring PyObjC to be preinstalled.

* Cocoa-Python-ObjC Application
 
  A project created from this template includes an embedded framework project
  into which all compiled (Objective-C) code can be placed.  Upon launch, 
  the application automatically dynamically loads the embedded framework 
  containing the compiled code.

  Each Framework's Resources directory is automatically added to sys.path.

* Cocoa-Python Document-based Application

  This template works like the Cocoa-Python Application template in that it
  is compatible with the Apple build of Python.   It creates an application 
  that uses Cocoa's Multiple Document Architecture in the same fashion as the
  default Cocoa Document-based Application supplied with Project Builder. 

More information on project templates can be found in the Project
Builder documentation and/or release notes.
