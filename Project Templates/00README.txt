Project Templates

To use the project templates, simply copy them into the Project
Templates directory used by Project Builder.   The following command
will add the "Cocoa-Python Application" template to the Application
group within Project Builder's new project wizard.

cp -r Cocoa-Python\ Application \
   /Developer/ProjectBuilder\ Extras/Project\ Templates/Application/
