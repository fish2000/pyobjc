API Notes: SpriteKit framework
===============================


The full API is described in `Apple's documentation`__, both
the C and Objective-C APIs are available (but see the `API Notes`_ below).

.. __: https://developer.apple.com/reference/spritekit/

These bindings are accessed through the ``SpriteKit`` package (that is, ``import SpriteKit``).

API Notes
---------

* ``vector_float3``: Values of this type are represented as tuples of 3 floats in Python.

* ``+[SKFieldNode customFieldWithEvaluationBlock:]``

  This method is not supported yet (requires changes to the core bridge)

.. note::

   This framework is only available on OSX 10.9 and later and requires a 64-bit binary.
