CWKeychainCopyEAPIdentity
.........................

This function returns a SecIdentityRef (by reference), the security
framework isn't wrapped by PyObjC at this time.

CWKeychainSetEAPIdentity
........................

This function has a SecIdentityRef argument, but because the
security framework isn't wrapped by PyObjC at this time it is
not yet possible to create values for this argument.
