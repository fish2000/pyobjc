<h1>Examples</h1>

<p>
Collected examples for the PyObjC module.  Includes command line tools, examples using Project Builder, and various examples of using the numerous APIs provided by Apple (and, eventually, GnuStep).
<p>
The examples are included in the source tarball and are installed in 
/Library/Developer/Examples/PyObjC when using the installer package. We will add
them to this website some time in the future.
