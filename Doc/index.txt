PyObjC documentation index
==========================

PyObjC is a bridge between Python and Objective-C. It allows you to write
Python scripts that use and extend existing Objective-C class libraries,
most importantly the `Cocoa libraries`_ by `Apple`_.

More information can be found on `our website <http://pyobjc.sf.net>`_

General user documentation
..........................

The following documents are useful when you're interested in developing
Cocoa applications in Python.

* `An introduction to PyObjC`_

  An overview of the PyObjC package and how to use it. Read this before
  you start using the package, it will help you to avoid some surprises.

* `Python classes and Objective-C code`_

  Another older overview of PyObjC. 

* `Notes on supported APIs and classes on MacOS X`_

  This document lists the methods and classes that are not fully supported,
  or supported in an 'unexpected' way.

Tutorials
.........

* `Creating your first PyObjC application (tutorial)`_

  This tutorial guides you though creating a Python based Cocoa application.

* `Adding Python code to an existing ObjC application`_

  This tutorial teaches you how to extend you existing Objective-C based
  Cocoa application using Python.

Examples
........

The source tree includes a number of examples, see the `list of examples`__ for
more information.

Technical documentation
.......................

These documents are only relevant if you want to modify PyObjC, not if
you want to write Cocoa programs in Python.

* `Coding style for PyObjC`_

  Rules for formatting code and documentation.

* `PyObjC Architecture`_

  An overview of the PyObjC architecture. This document is out of date.

* `Structure of the PyObjC package`_

  Another overview of the PyObjC package.

* `How to wrap an Objective-C class library`_

  This explains how you can provide a python wrapper for an existing 
  Objective-C class library.

* `Project Builder Python Support`_

  Describes the Python support for Project Builder, including a TODO list for
  future versions.
