subject: ANN: PyObjC 0.9

PyObjC 0.9 is now available for download at http://pyobjc.sourceforge.net/  

PyObjC is a bridge between Python and Objective-C.  It allows full
featured Cocoa applications to be written in pure Python.  It is also
easy to use other frameworks containing Objective-C class libraries
from Python and to mix in Objective-C, C and C++ source.

Python is a highly dynamic programming language with a shallow learning 
curve.  It combines remarkable power with very clear syntax.

The installer package includes a number of Project Builder templates for 
easily creating new Cocoa-Python projects.  Version 0.9 also introduces 
support for sytax coloring of Python files in Project Builder.

PyObjC also supports full introspection of Objective-C classes and 
direct invocation of Objective-C APIs from the interactive interpreter.

PyObjC requires MacOS X 10.2 or later.  PyObjC works both with the Apple 
provided Python installation in MacOS X 10.2 (and later) and with 
MacPython 2.3b1.  Users of MacPython 2.3b1 can install PyObjC though the 
PackageManager application.

PyObjC 0.9 includes many inprovements over earlier versions and users are 
strongly advised to upgrade.  The installer package will automatically upgrade
prior releases.

PyObjC is released with an open source license.

[ This is a variation on the 0.8 text, I've switched the roles
  of Python and Objective-C as this seems to be more natural to
  me ]
