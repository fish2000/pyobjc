Coding style for PyObjC 
=======================

Introduction
------------

This document describes the coding style for PyObjC. Please use this style for
new code and try apply this style to existing code while working on it.

*NOTE* This document is a work in progress and does _not_ describe the existing
code.

Python code
-----------

The coding style for core Python is used (see `PEP 8`_). For consistency with
Cocoa we use mixed-case identifiers (like lookUpClass). 

PyObjC extensions to Apple frameworks should be clearly marked as such, 
preferably by prefixing names with 'PyObjC' or 'pyobjc'. This should make it
clear to users where they should look for documentation of an item: The Apple
documentation or ours.

The entire 'objc' module is an "extension" and all items exported from that
module should be documented in our documentation.

.. _`PEP 8`: http://www.python.org/peps/pep-0008.txt

C code
------

The coding style for core Python is used (see `PEP 7`_). We use 'PyObjC' instead
of 'Py' as the prefix for globally visible symbols.

Documentation
-------------

All items exported by the objc module and all PyObjC extensions to Apple
frameworks (the AppKit and Foundation modules) should be documented using
docstrings. See `PEP 257`_ for good docstring conventions.

All other documents should be marked up using reStructedText_.
