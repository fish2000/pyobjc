========================
Using LibFFI with PyObjC
========================

:author: Ronald Oussoren

PyObjC uses libffi to dynamicly call into Objective-C. We use libffi instead of
NSInvocation because the former makes it possible to call superclass methods,
and to generate stubs for use in Objective-C method tables on the fly.

It is currently possible to build a non-ffi build of PyObjC, but that is not
supported and will be removed as we use features from libffi to further 
improve the brigde.
