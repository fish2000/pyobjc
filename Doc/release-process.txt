==========================
The PyObjC release process
==========================

.. :author: Ronald Oussoren

This document gives an exhaustive overview of what needs to be done when 
building and releasing a new version of PyObjC. It is meant for the project
administrators, and not of much use for users of PyObjC.

The timeframe is a guideline only and should be taken with a grain of salt.

Release date -2 weeks
---------------------

Full feature freeze, documenation updates and critical bugfixes only. At this
time:

* Check if the NEWS file is up-to-date

* Tests the tutorial(s)
  Read the tutorial(s) and follow the instructions exactly, the tutorials should
  be completely bugfree.

* Proofread the documentation

* Update the announcement messages.

Release-date -3 days
---------------------

Build the release tarball and dmg:

* Add the correct date to the NEWS file, and set the right version in
  ``Modules/objc/pyobjc.h``.

* Run Scripts/make_distrib.py

* Create an empty disk image (named ``PyObjC X.Y``) and copy the installer
  package, License and ReadMe to this disk image. Resize the icons in this
  folder to largish icons (about 64 pixels) and resize the view to be just
  large enough to contain the icons.

  NOTE: This should be scripted, and maybe we should add a nice background
  image to the folder.

Trash you existing PyObjC installation and reinstall from the new release. Test
that the new release is working correctly. Installing and testing should be done
both for the binary installer and for the source archive. The latter should be
done in all supported configurations.

If the package works as expected upload to a convenient location and ask some
other people (like the other maintainers) to test the new release.

Release-date

* Upload the release files to sourceforge

* add a news item to the website and update the download page

* add the latest documentation to the website (run scripts/doc2php in
  the pyobjc-web tree).
