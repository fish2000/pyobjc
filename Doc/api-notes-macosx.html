<h2>Notes on supported APIs and classes on MacOS X</h2>
<!-- :author: Ronald Oussoren -->
<h2><a name="introduction">Introduction</a></h2>
<p><i>NOTE</i>: This document is very incomplete.</p>
<p>This document describes the restrictions w.r.t. supported APIs and classes
on MacOS X. In general you can use classes and global functions just like
in Objective-C (e.g. the Apple developer documentaton applies), but in some
cases there are special considerations.</p>
<p>We also do not provide access to global functions that are not usefull for
Python programs, those functions are listed below.</p>
<p>The general rules are listed in ..., this document provides the exceptions to
those rules.</p>
<p>This document is target at the latest supported version of MacOS X (currenlty
MacOS X 10.2.x), unless specifically noted the same restrictions apply to 
earlier versions of MacOS X. Earlier versions of the OS have less extensive
APIs, PyObjC does <i>not</i> provide a compatibility layer.</p>
<p>Frameworks not listed below are not wrapped by PyObjC, they can still be
accessed although without access to constants and global functions defined
by those frameworks.</p>
<h2><a name="addressbook-framework">Addressbook framework</a></h2>
<p>We do not provide access to the global functions in that framework, because
the same functionality can be accessed by using the object-oriented interface.</p>
