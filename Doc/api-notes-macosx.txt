Notes on supported APIs and classes on MacOS X
==============================================

Introduction
------------

*NOTE*: This document is very incomplete.

This document describes the restrictions w.r.t. supported APIs and classes
on MacOS X. In general you can use classes and global functions just like
in Objective-C (e.g. the Apple developer documentaton applies), but in some
cases there are special considerations.

We also do not provide access to global functions that are not usefull for
Python programs, those functions are listed below.

The general rules are listed in ..., this document provides the exceptions to
those rules.

This document is target at the latest supported version of MacOS X (currenlty
MacOS X 10.2.x), unless specifically noted the same restrictions apply to 
earlier versions of MacOS X. Earlier versions of the OS have less extensive
APIs, PyObjC does *not* provide a compatibility layer.

Frameworks not listed below are not wrapped by PyObjC, they can still be
accessed although without access to constants and global functions defined
by those frameworks.

Addressbook framework
---------------------

We do not provide access to the global functions in that framework, because
the same functionality can be accessed by using the object-oriented interface.

AppKit framework
----------------

NSPoint is a tuple of 2 floats, or use ``AppKit.NSMakePoint()``.

NSSize is a tuple of 2 floats, or use ``AppKit.NSMakeSize()``.

NSRect is a tuple of an NSPoint and an NSSize, or use ``AppKit.NSMakeRect()``.

Class NSBezierPath
..................

* ``getLineDash:count:phase:``
  This method is not supported, I (Ronald) could not find a way to detect the
  required size for the pattern buffer. 

* ``appendBezierPathWithGlyphs:count:inFont:``
  The first argument is a list of integers, count should be at most the lenght
  of the first argument.

* ``appendBezierPathWithPoints:count:``
  The first argument is a list of points, count should be at most the lenght
  of the first argument. 

* ``setAssociatedPoints:atIndex:``
  Implementing this method in Python is not yet supported.

* All other methods are supported (MacOS X 10.2)


Foundation framework
--------------------

The ``-forward::`` method is not supported. It's functionality can be accessed
using the python function ``apply``. The ``performv::`` method is also not
supported, with a simular work-around.

Class NSDictionary
..................

The (undocumented) methods ``getKeys:``, ``getObjects:`` and 
``getObjects:andKeys:`` are not supported.

Class NSFault
.............

The ``extraData`` argument/return value for ``-extraData`` and 
``setTargetClassextraData:`` is represented as an integer.


InterfaceBuilder framework

PreferencePanes framework
