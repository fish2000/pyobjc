API Notes: OpenDirectory and CFOpenDirectory frameworks
=======================================================

The full API is described in `Apple's documentation`__, both
the C and Objective-C APIs are available (but see the `API Notes`_ below).

.. __: https://developer.apple.com/reference/opendirectory/

These bindings are accessed through the ``OpenDirectory`` package (that is, ``import OpenDirectory``).


API Notes
---------

Both the OpenDirectory framework and the embedded CFOpenDirectory framework are fully wrapped
and can be used as described in the generic PyObjC documentation.

ODQuerySetCallback
..................

The callback function is stored by the framework, the callable can therefore not be
a generic callable, but must be a callable that is annotated using the ``objc.callbackFor``
decorator::

   @objc.callbackFor("CFOpenDirectory.ODQuerySetCallback")
   def query_callback(query, value, context, error, info):
      pass

The ``userInfo`` argument needs to be an integer.

ODQuerySetDispatchQueue
.......................

This function is not supported because PyObjC doesn't interface with dispatch queues yet.
