Description: 
        PyObjC is a bridge between Python and Objective-C.  It allows full
        featured Cocoa applications to be written in pure Python.  It is also
        easy to use other frameworks containing Objective-C class libraries
        from Python and to mix in Objective-C, C and C++ source.
        
        Python is a highly dynamic programming language with a shallow learning
        curve.  It combines remarkable power with very clear syntax.
        
        The installer package installs a number of Xcode templates for
        easily creating new Cocoa-Python projects.
        
        PyObjC also supports full introspection of Objective-C classes and
        direct invocation of Objective-C APIs from the interactive interpreter.
        
        PyObjC requires MacOS X 10.3 or later.  PyObjC works both with the Apple
        provided Python installation in MacOS X 10.3 (and later) and with
        MacPython 2.3 and later.
